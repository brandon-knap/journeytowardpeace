        <p class="description">Since the beginning of 2019, I have been traveling a lot! I have made it a priority to visit as many programs as I possibly can, so that I can learn as much as possible about how things are changing and how treatments are evolving. I feel it is important for me to really get to know different programs&ndash;the facility, the ammenities, the staff, even the food provided. Each has something that makes it different than the others.</p>

        <p class="description">After visiting a wide range of therapeutic programs, families can rely on an IECA member to guide them through the critical process of finding the right program for their child. The level of placement recommendation is determined by a very thorough process that includes the independent educational consultant working with the family, records review, and speaking with professionals that are involved with the case. Listed below are program descriptors for the continuum of care that is available.</p>

        <p class="description">Studies indicate that for many, sexual problematic behavior first begins during the adolescent years. According to Youth First, the average age of a child the first time they see internet pornography is 11 years. Some studies indicate the actual age may be as young as 7 years. Early intervention is essential for avoiding a lifetime of future problems from untreated compulsive sexual behavior. Psychotherapy and the development of values-based characteristics are key aspects to treating these issues in teens and young children.</p>

        <p class="description">If you are a parent considering a therapeutic program for your child, it can be overwhelming! There are so many programs available. It is difficult to get much information from a school&rsquo;s website, because often programs have similar information posted. However, each program has its own personality and speciality, just as each child has a unique personality and talents.
Journey Toward Peace helps parents of struggling adolescents/teens find a program that is best for their specific needs and individual situations.</p>

I have to be honest, I am sucked in to these particular stories, because of my own experience with an out of control teen. I have such empathy for the families and the teens. I must admit, I have a tendency to compare the situation I was in, with the stories I am watching.</p>

        <p class="description">When speaking with mental health professionals, the discussion often involves trauma as a factor in mental health and addiction. The research from ACE (Adverse Childhood Experiences) Study, indicates that the long-lasting effects of childhood trauma is significant. The need to uncover the underlying trauma is critical in treating addiction and mental illness successfully. It is very important for clients to have a safe therapeutic environment, so they will be able to reveal their trauma history, and start the healing process.</p>

      <div class="post-details">
        <p class="description">Therapeutic boarding schools are residential facilities designed to house struggling teens or adolescents while they get intensive, ongoing help with a range of issues. The benefits of a therapeutic school are many, because the facilities provide everything a teen, and their family, need to support recovery.
It may seem drastic for parents to place their child in a boarding school, but often it is the best solution for the family. It is important for a family to compare therapeutic boarding school programs, because they offer different programs for therapy, academics, and family involvement.</p>
