              <p>I have just placed a client in a wonderful residential treatment center, after working diligently to find just the right fit. I say it that way, because this was an exceptionally challenging case for several reasons. The timing was difficult, the age of the client was tricky, and several other factors came in to consideration during the process.</p>

<p>I enter in to each of my placements with one objective&hellip;to do the very best I can to find the best treatment facility for the specific individual. It may be a wilderness program, followed by a therapeutic boarding school or residential treatment center, and it may be a recovery center with a step down treatment program. Whatever it is, it has to be specifically equipped to treat the individual client.</p>

<p>With the placement I have been working with, I was on the phone for hours talking with programs about whether they had availability, and whether they could work with the specific needs of the client. I was amazed at the kindness and generosity of the admissions counselors. Each program I spoke with was willing to spend the time necessary to answer all questions and listened carefully to what I was saying. They all wanted to help. They all had the same objective that I have. They want to help find the very best fit for their clients. If a program did not think they would be able to meet all of the clients needs, they were forthcoming, and willing to refer a program that may be a better fit.</p>

<p>Also, I was overwhelmed by the support and encouragement that I received from the IECA (Independent Education Consultant Association) members. They were go generous with their time and support! I am blessed to be a member of such a wonderful group of professionals.</p>

<p>Having the ability to help families find the right treatment for their individual needs and having a great community of support has really been amazing. I am so thankful to being doing this work! This is truly doing what I love and loving what I&rsquo;m doing!</p>
