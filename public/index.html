                <h4>Understanding This Journey</h4>
                <p>After personally experiencing the struggle of having a child in crisis, I have become passionate about helping families encountering similar issues. For over ten years, I worked in a high school counseling office, and observed an increase in the difficulties adolescents, teens, young adults and their families face. The pressures of academics, social media, relationships, transitioning to college and/or career, and the increasing use of substances at alarmingly earlier ages, has resulted in a rise in anxiety and depression in our society. Some adolescents, teens and young adults respond well with weekly therapy and intensive outpatient programs. However, some require additional intervention. Finding the program that best fits the individual family’s needs can be overwhelming but finding the right program can be life changing! Journey Toward Peace exists to help families find the program that allows their loved one to discover the peace they desire, and in turn, bring some peace to the family.</p>
