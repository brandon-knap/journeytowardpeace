    <meta name="description" content="What if, in our conflicts with others, there is something we want more than solutions? What if, individually and collectively, we systematically misunderstand the causes of our conflicts? And what if, therefore, we unwittingly perpetuate the very problems we think we are trying to solve? These are among the important questions explored in The Anatomy of Peace, an international bestseller that instills hope and inspires reconciliation. Through a moving story of parents who are struggling with their own children and with problems that have come to consume their lives, we learn from once-bitter enemies the way to transform personal, professional, and even global conflicts.">
