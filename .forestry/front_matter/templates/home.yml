    the struggle of having a child in crisis, I have become passionate about helping
    other families dealing with similar situations. Over the past ten years, I have
    worked in a high school counseling office, and have seen an increase in the difficulties
    adolescents, teens and their families face. The pressures of academics, social
    media, relationships and the increasing use of substances at alarmingly earlier
    ages, has resulted in a rise in anxiety and depression in our youth. Some adolescents
    and teens respond well with weekly therapy and intensive outpatient programs.
    Some, however, need additional intervention. Finding the program that best fits
    your individual family needs can be life changing. My hope is to assist families
    find the program that allows them find the peace they desire.</p><h4>Our Daughter's
    Journey</h4><p>My name is Isabella, I am a now a sophomore in college, and living
    in Arizona with my dog, Carti, and my friends. When I was 16 years old, over Christmas
    break my parents made the choice to enroll me in a therapeutic boarding school
    in Arizona. When I learned this was happening, I felt as if my life was crumbling!
    What I also knew was that I was in a place in my life where I needed extra help.
    My parents had exhausted all local resources, and I needed more to reach me in
    my place of deep desperation. I didn’t like who I was, and that caused me to succumb
    to many things and choices that were not healthy. I struggled with depression,
    and wasn’t able to find a way to cope that worked for me. By going to a therapeutic
    boarding school, I was able to have a break from daily pressures and realize I
    was not alone. I was able to find myself, again, and was able to graduate from
    high school. I developed friendships with people who understood what I was going
    through and were right there to support me. Being away from my family was difficult,
    but during my time away, I was able to learn to appreciate them and understand
    that they were doing an amazing thing for me. They were doing something for me
    that not every family would be willing to do for their child. My family gave me
    the chance to be the person I am today. I love school, I have a great job working
    at my favorite clothing store, and I appreciate who I am, and the people I have
    in my life. I thank God that I was given the numerous opportunities and chances
    to succeed, because my family was willing to believe in me, and to never give
    up. For that, I am ever grateful!</p>"
