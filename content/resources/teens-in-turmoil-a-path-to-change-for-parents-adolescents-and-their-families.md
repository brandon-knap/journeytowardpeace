Sometimes it's a little thing-the way a teen dresses-or something more serious, like finding drugs in their bedroom. Whatever the circumstances, say authors Carol Maxym and Leslie York, the turning point comes when your child's out-of-control behavior takes control of the entire family.

Teens in Turmoil helps concerned parents turn fear and desperation into hope and action. Maxym and York guide parents in charting a course to getting their families-and teens-back on track.
