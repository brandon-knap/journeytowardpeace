**Is your child worried about an uncertain school year?**

_Elementary and middle school students are facing rising levels of depression and anxiety during the pandemic_.

• They may be torn between wanting to see their friends and being afraid of contracting the virus.

• If learning virtually, they may feel isolated and have trouble following or engaging.

• They may still be hurting over missed opportunities from the spring and summer.

• They may feel guilty for actions they took that may be negatively affecting other members of their household.

• They may be fearful of the future and the unknown.

**THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND:**

• Stress affects everyone.

• Not everyone reacts to stress in the same way.

• Not all stress is bad.

Even so, most children are aware that the pandemic threatens everyone’s safety and they may be feeling anxious and depressed. For this reason, it’s even more important to watch for warning signs.
