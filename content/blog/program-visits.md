Since the beginning of 2019, I have been traveling a lot! I have made it a priority to visit as many programs as I possibly can, so that I can learn as much as possible about how things are changing and how treatments are evolving.

What I am finding is that the individuals working in therapeutic boarding schools, residential treatment centers, and wilderness programs are very passionate about what they do. They are working hard to help students and families understand what is going on and what changes need to be made in order for healing to occur. Getting to the core of the issues is what they do best. Then the counselors are able to help work through the challenges and individualize treatment accordingly. Because of the small number of students each counselor works with, they are able to customize therapy for the specific needs of each family. This is so important, because no two situations are the same.

One of the things that I have enjoyed the most during the visits is speaking with the students. It is wonderful to be able to hear them talk about how they came to be in the program, what they have learned, and what they plan to do in the future. Most students say that when they first arrived at wilderness/therapeuitc boarding school/residential treatment they were not happy. They did not feel accountable for their behavior and placed blame on those around them. However, overwhelmingly, the students say that through the process, they have realized the impact of their behavior on others and are willing to own their role in the relationship.

The ability for our adolescents and young adults to remove themselves from the distractions around them, and focus on what is important is an amazing gift.
