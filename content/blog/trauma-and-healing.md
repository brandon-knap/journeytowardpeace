When speaking with mental health professionals, the discussion often involves trauma as a factor in mental health and addiction. The research from ACE (Adverse Childhood Experiences) Study, indicates that the long-lasting effects of childhood trauma is significant. The need to uncover the underlying trauma is critical in treating addiction and mental illness successfully. It is very important for clients to have a safe therapeutic environment, so they will be able to reveal their trauma history, and start the healing process. This is possible to establish in many out-patient situations however, there are times when it can be very difficult, especially with adolescents and young adults. It can be challenging for them to maintain the vulnerability to address their trauma when they must reestablish their defenses in their home and school settings. There is research that indicates that Therapeutic Wilderness treatment is a safe place for clients to reveal and further address the impact of their trauma.

Therapeutic Wilderness therapy is an adventure-based therapy treatment modality for behavior modification and interpersonal self-improvement, combining experiential education, individual and group therapy in a wilderness setting. The clients are separated from electronics, phones, drugs and alcohol. They maintain their prescribed medication schedule, have healthy meals, consistent sleep schedules, exercise daily and participate in experiential activities. The peer and therapeutic support is available for growth and healing.

Wilderness therapy programs should not be considered a “last resort”. They are often the best, safest places for a client to truly begin their journey to restoring a healthy and happy life, addressing their greatest challenges, and reconcile family communication.
